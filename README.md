 62410 CDIO-Project Spring 24
In this project we have been in a process of designing, developing, and implementing a robotic solution using the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 with the purpose of collecting golf balls in a driving range for participating in the GolfBot competition. 
From our project scope, our main goal for the entire project was to create a solution, where the robot completely autonomous would collect the balls within/less than 8 minutes, 
and also be able to put all the balls within the small goal for optimal point scoring. 
In this report we will go through each step in our process from project plan, project management, technical considerations, final product and finally a conclusion.
